Iâ€™ve developed on a number of platforms and devices in a variety of languages. Currently I'm focused on iOS development. Some of the enterprise iOS projects I've worked on include apps for [OfferUp](https://offerup.com), NEC, Intel, Disney, and Toyota. I currently spend my days at [Grab](https://grab.com) focused on safety features for hundreds of millions of customers in Southeast Asia.
